My sandbox and playground for python tests/experiments.

Be aware that most of the code is not complete and probably doesn't work properly.

This is a **mono-repo** with all sorts of (mostly rubbish) python code.

## Setup

- Use `pyenv` to manage python versions.
- Use `poetry` to manage the dependencies.
- Use `ruff` to organize the imports, lint, and format.

Run `make help` to see the available tasks.
