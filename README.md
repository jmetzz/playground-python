# sandbox-python

My sandbox and playground for python tests/experiments.

Be aware that most of the code is not complete and probably doesn't work properly.

This is a **mono-repo** with all sorts of (mostly rubbish) python code.

## Setup

- Use `pyenv` to manage python versions.
- Use `poetry` to manage the dependencies.
- Use `isort` to organize the imports.
- Use `black` for code formatting.
- Use `flake9` to keep the code more or less clean.

In some sub-repositories (sub-directories) I've added a Makefile to 
simplify environment creation and dependency installation.

Run `make help` to see the available tasks.
