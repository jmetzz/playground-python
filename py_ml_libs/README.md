This repository contains the code that I write/wrote while learning python machine learning frameworks and libraries.

Thus, it is basically a sandbox with examples.

Current sub-modules are:

* NumPy examples: NumPy specializes in numerical processing through multi-dimensional ndarrays, where the arrays allow element-by-element operations, a.k.a. broadcasting.
* SciPy examples: built on the NumPy array framework and takes scientific programming to a whole new level by supplying advanced mathematical functions like integration, ordinary differential equation solvers, special functions, optimizations, and more.
