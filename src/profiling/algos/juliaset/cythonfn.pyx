    When adding Cython annotations, youâ€™re adding non-Python code to the .pyx file. This means you lose the interactive nature of developing Python in the interpreter.

    It is important to note that these types will be understood only by Cython and not by Python. Cython uses these types to convert the Python code to C objects, which do not have to call back into the Python stack; this means the operations run at a faster speed, but they lose flexibility and development speed.
