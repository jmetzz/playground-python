"""Write a function that takes in a target string and an array of strings.

The function should return a 2D array containing all the ways that target can be constructed
by concatenating elements from the word_bank array. Each element of the 2D array should
represent one combination that constructs the target.

You may reuse elements of the word_bank as many times as needed.
