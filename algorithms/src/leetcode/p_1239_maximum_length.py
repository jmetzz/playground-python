1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a
subsequence of arr that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or
no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


Example 1:

Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").
Example 3:

Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
Explanation: The only string in arr has all 26 characters.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 16
1 <= arr[i].length <= 26
arr[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
