76. Minimum Window Substring
Hard

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.



Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.


Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Hint 1: Use two pointers to create a window of letters in s,
which would have all the characters from t.

Hint 2: Expand the right pointer until all the characters of t are covered.

Hint 3: Once all the characters are covered, move the left pointer
and ensure that all the characters are still covered to minimize the subarray size.

Hint 4: Continue expanding the right and left pointers until
you reach the end of s.


Explanation:

Goal: find the minimum window in string s that contains all the characters in string t, in ANY ORDER.

Technique: Sliding Window
- Use two pointers (l and r) represent the left and right ends of the current window
- Use a map (ie, dict) to count occurrences of characters in string t.
- Use a curr_win_count object to keeps track of the number of characters within the current window.
- To maintain the window, you can either expand or shrink it.
  - To expand, you need to move the right pointer to expand the window, and check if
  the characters in the current windows statisfy the required counts from t. If satisfied,
  increment formed (count of characters satisfying the required counts)
  - To shrink, you need to move the left pointer and update the minimum window size if a smaller
  valid window is found. Continue until a smaller valid window is not possible of the right pointer
  reaches the end of the string
